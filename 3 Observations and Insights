1. The capomulin drug regimen had the most amount of mice that saw a reduction in tumor volume over time

2. capomulin not only had one of the lowest tumor means amongst the four drugs, it also had a larger number of 
mice using the drug

3. Given that the average tumor size was larger if the weight of the mouse was heavier. Male mice tend weigh more
than females, so the average tumor size of each gender of mice will be very different given there are fewer female
mice in the study causing the charts depictng this are not depicting where the weights change from strictly female,
a mix of male female, and then strictly male. Since certain drugs may be more effective depending on the tumor size.
